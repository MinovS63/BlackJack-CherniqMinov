There is a tutorial in the game if you dont know how to play but i will type it again here:
Blackjack is a poker game. The main objective is for your cards' sum to be 21 or closer to 21 than the house's cards. You are given two cards face up, while the house gets one card face up and one face down.

Card values are as follows: J, K, and Q are worth 10; A is worth 11; and 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 have points equal to their face value.

You have two options: hit or stand. If you choose hit, you receive one more card, but rememberâ€”if your card sum exceeds 21, you lose. You can have a maximum of three cards at a time, meaning only one hit is available. After that, you are automatically put on stand.

If you choose stand, you don't get an extra third card. The house then flips its second card. If its total is lower than yours, the dealer automatically hits. If their total is higher than yours, you lose the game and your bet. If the dealer hits and their total remains lower than yours, they lose and you win.

If you don't understand, just play, and you'll get the hang of it. Good luck!
